landing page is the first page that we are considering when we open a website.
after landing page, you can directly go for sign up or log in.
after signing up or logging in, we are going to the homepage.
In home page, variety of requests would be present in the form of cards.
each card when clicked, consists a description page.
In the description page, we have embedded bidding system and chat box(which is disabled at the moment).
If your bidding gets selected, the chatbox will open where you can communicate with the firm representative.
we have also a rating system(not working currently).

(On a side note, being a complete newbie for front-end web development, not only I have learned so many concepts of html and css just in 2 days but also loved how the things worked out).
